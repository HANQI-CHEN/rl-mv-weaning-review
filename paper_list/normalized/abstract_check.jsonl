Both prolonged dependence on mechanical ventilation and premature extubation are associated with increased risk of complications and higher hospital costs, but clinical opinion on the best protocol for weaning patients off of a ventilator varies. This work aims to develop a decision support tool that uses available patient information to predict time-to-extubation readiness and to recommend a personalized regime of sedation dosage and ventilator support. To this end, we use off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms to determine the best action at a given patient state from sub-optimal historical ICU data. We compare treatment policies from fitted Q-iteration with extremely randomized trees and with feedforward neural networks, and demonstrate that the policies learnt show promise in recommending weaning protocols with improved outcomes, in terms of minimizing rates of reintubation and regulating physiological stability.", "match_mv_abs": true, "match_wean_abs": true, "match_rl_abs": true, "decision": "keep"}

This study aims to improve the current extubation protocols by incorporating predictive information on patient health conditions. We develop a discrete-time, finite-horizon Markov decision process with predictions of future state to support extubation decisions. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy and provide important insights into how predictive information can lead to different decision protocols. We demonstrate that adding predictive information is always beneficial, even if physicians place excessive trust in the predictions, as long as the predictive model is moderately accurate. Using a comprehensive data set from an ICU in a tertiary hospital in Singapore, we evaluate the effectiveness of various policies and demonstrate that incorporating predictive information can reduce ICU length of stay by up to 3.4% and, simultaneously, decrease the extubation failure rate by up to 20.3%, compared with the optimal policy that does not utilize prediction. These benefits are more significant for patients with poor initial conditions upon ICU admission. Both our analytical and numerical findings suggest that predictive information is particularly valuable in identifying patients who could benefit from continued intubation, thereby allowing for personalized and delayed extubation for these patients.
